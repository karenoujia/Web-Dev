# Welcome to my web development portfolio!
Beautiful websites are what first drew me to programming when I was in high school. After several years of exploring my other interests in college, I finally rekindled my love for web development.

Here you will find some of the small projects I have done on the side for fun (mostly by watching online tutorials and teaching myself how to create prettier designs and code more elegantly). Hope you enjoy ‚ù§
